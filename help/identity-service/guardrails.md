# Guardrails for [!DNL Identity Service] data

This document provides information on use and rate limits for [!DNL Identity Service] data to help you optimize your use of the identity graph. When reviewing the following guardrails, it is assumed that you have modeled the data correctly. If you have questions on how to model your data, please contact your customer service representative.

## Getting started

The following Experience Platform services are involved with modeling Identity data: 

* [Identities](home.md): Bridge identities from disparate data sources as they are ingested into Platform.
* [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](../profile/home.md): Create unified consumer profiles using data from multiple sources.

## Data model limits

The tables below provide guidance on guardrails for static limits as well as validation rules to consider for identity namespaces.

### Static limits

The following table outlines static limits applied to identity data.

| Guardrail | Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of identities in a graph | 150 | The limit is applied at the sandbox level. The identity graph will not be updated once the limit is reached. |
| Number of identities in an XDM record | 20 | The minimum number of XDM records required is two. |
| Number of custom namespaces | None | There are no limits to the number of custom namespaces you can create. |
| Number of graphs | None | There are no limits to the number of identity graphs you can create. |
| Number of characters for a namespace display name or identity symbol | None | There are no limits to the number of characters of a namespace display name or identity symbol. |

### Identity value validation

The following table outlines existing rules you must follow to ensure a successful validation of your identity value.

| Namespace | Validation rule | System behavior when rule is violated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ECID | <ul><li>The identity value of an ECID must be exactly 38 characters.</li><li>The identity value of an ECID must consist of numbers only.</li></ul> | <ul><li>If the identity value of ECID is not exactly 38 characters, then the record is skipped.</li><li>If the identity value of ECID contains non-numerical characters, then the record is skipped.</li></ul> |
| Non-ECID | The identity value cannot exceed 1024 characters. | If the identity value exceeds 1024 characters, then the record is skipped. |
